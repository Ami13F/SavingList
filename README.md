# Tool Name

## Previous Workflow

TODO - Describe how the process was managed before using your tool. Specify how many hours can be saved by using this project.

Every day we need to buy something, we forget, and do it again. Over and over.
We spend at least 1 or 2 hours every day to go to the store, chose what we want then look into all
the new items that were place by purpose there to distract us and feel our dopamine.
If we don't really need something from the market, will feel the need to order, to get a fresh air
for our houses, or just we missed that we need to refil our parfume, new clothes, or no matter what just navigate
on websites and get lost for hours.
That's around at least 7h every week, 210h per month, and 2520h each year.
Do you really want to waste that time? Well, you'll say I need those things more or less.
But are you sure you need them Right Now?

## Solution Description

TODO - Provide a brief overview of the tool, explaining its purpose and functionality.

We propose a time saver for long and short term purchases.
Will reduce considerably the time with 3 simple categories:
* Today
* Soon
* Long term

Where Today - represents the must haves for our day, yes, like a simple shopping list that we can check 
on an online app at home, or just include in any time of the day when you are closer to a store, because
you will have only few items on this list
 Soon - are items that are almost finised at home and need replacement, like toothpaste, to not buy it only when
 it's done. This is the one who's trying to keep Today's list empty, to not shop until Soon list became Today.

 Long term - everything you feel you'll need, but definetly you can live without them now, this list is the key,
 you don't go buying things, until you have time for it, or when you have multiple items and buy all at once.

### This is a story of simple things, that handle important parts of our lives. That gives meaning for...
### More Time.

## Deployment

TODO - Deploy your full-stack solution using [genezio](https://genez.io/). You can use [these examples](https://github.com/Genez-io/genezio-examples) as a starting point.

TODO - Provide a link to your live app so we can test it out.

Used Typescript and React.
Need to setup values for mongoDb connection.
This is an MVP. Not the final solution, but a promising idea :)
